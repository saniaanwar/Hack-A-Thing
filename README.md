# Hack-A-Thing - IoT Hackathon

Our Project - An Automated Robotic Arm Control System

An intuitive multi-modal robotic arm control system that combines manual input and sensor-based automation using the Nordic nRF7002-DK. 
Designed for precision and accessibility, this project demonstrates how human-friendly controls can power intelligent robotic manipulation.
